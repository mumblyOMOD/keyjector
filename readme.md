# This Fork
The intent of this fork of KeyJector is to update the utilities related to Logitech Unifying receivers and nrf24 to use Python 3.

To the best of my knowledge the updates to the flashing software is complete and functional (I've used it on a receiver I own).

I've tested the nrf24 based utilities and they appear to work (or at least haven't thrown any errors when I've tested them), but I haven't compared the output to the output when using Python 2 so I can't guarantee anything.

# KeyJector

Somewhat unified keystroke injection tool collection for 2.4 GHz wireless input devices.

Based on the following projects by Marc Newlin and Bastille Research:
